# Overview.
### So, You're probably wondering how to use this, if so then here is a general overview.
#test
If you read over the defmovie.py file,

then it probably wont make sense if you haven't also seen the guipython file, they work together in a sense that, if they don't work in congunction, they don't work that great.

If you run the guipython file you will see:
![example](/assets/thumbnails/filename_picture.png)

--This will probably change in the future, but it'll look something like this

You put the filename of the video, by default, it will give you filename based
on the video files in assets/videos, for example:
You have 5 video files, they're named cat1.mp4, cat2.mkv, cat3.mp4, etc.

it will remove the extension "mp4, mkv".

and remove the numbers "1, 2, 3".

it'll remain just being "cat", and it'll add "-compilation" at the end of it, making it "cat-compilation".

just make sure the videos in the assets/videos folder are numbered, this code will break if they are not.

It's good practice to give your files a number after naming them: make sure all of your video files are named the same except for their numbered parts.

"download1.mp4", "download2.mp4".

"vine1.mp4", "vine2.mp4

will work, just make sure they are numbered and are named the same.

also, if you click this:

![random](/assets/thumbnails/random_picture.png)

It'll give your file a random filename from the functions/random_names.py folder

Oh and, by the way in these entrys:
![numbered](/assets/thumbnails/numbered.png)

0 is the lowest, and 1 is the highest
1 being 100%, 0.5 is 50%, you get how it works.

and, that's basically it, if you're ready to make the video, click this:

![button](/assets/thumbnails/button.png)

thats it, if you really wanna know how it works, go through the code.

I've put some music in the assets/music folder

some videos in the assets/video folder

and a watermark in the assets/pictures folder

just so you can see how it works, when you feel like you wanna use your own music, your own videos, and your own watermarks, 

you can change them, just make sure the watermark is named watermark.png

You don't even have to put any filenames, add any music, or tick any checkboxes, if you click make video it'll work with all the default settings.
